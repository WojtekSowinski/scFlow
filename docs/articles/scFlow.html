<h2 id="running-scflow">Running <em>scFlow</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#running-scflow"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>scFlow</code> pipeline requires three main input: a folder
containing <code>matrix.mtx.gz</code>, <code>features.tsv.gz</code>,
<code>barcodes.tsv.gz</code> for individual samples, a SampleSheet.tsv
file which is a tab-separated-variable file with sample metadata and a
Manifest.txt file is a tab-separated-variable file with two columns:
<code>key</code> and <code>filepath</code>. Details of how to generate
the files is given in this <a href="https://github.com/combiz/scFlow/wiki/Generating-a-Manifest-File-and-SampleSheet-for-scFlow" class="external-link">page</a></p>
<p>The basic <code>scFlow</code> workflow for sample QC begins with the
import of the feature-barcode sparse matrix with
<code>read_sparse_matrix</code>. The metadata for the sample is then
imported from a sample sheet with <code>read_metadata</code>. A
SingleCellExperiment object is created from the matrix and the metadata
using <code>generate_sce</code> which is then annotated with both gene
and cell-level data using <code>annotate_sce</code>. We then filter the
SingleCellExperiment to select only cells and genes meeting our QC
criteria using <code>filter_sce</code>. We can then optionally find
singlets in our filtered SingleCellExperiment using
<code>find_singlets</code> before filtering them out again with
<code>filter_sce</code>. A complete QC report can then be generated
using <code>report_qc_sce</code> before saving the filtered and
quality-controlled SingleCellExperiment with <code>write_sce</code>.</p>

<p>To run scFlow, we first need to read in the data matrix:</p>

<p>Next, we retrieve the metadata by pointing to a Sample Sheet and
specifying a unique identifier (unique_key) in a specific column

<p>For downstream analyses it’s important that the variable classes are
correctly specified. Carefully inspect the metadata classes in brackets.
In the above example we see that the <em>individual</em> were imported
as integer rather than factor variables. Let’s correct this by reloading
the metadata, this time specifying the correct variable classes for this
variable:-</p>

<p>With the metadata imported with the correct variable classes, and the

<p>In <code>scFlow</code> we specify all of our QC preferences and
cutoffs with the <code>annotate_sce</code> command. This will also
produce plots in the <code>sce@metadata</code> slot allowing rapid
revision and optimization of QC parameters. Lets start with the default
parameters by simply providing the <code>SingleCellExperiment</code>
object to the <code>annotate_sce</code> function:-</p>

<p>Once we merge all the samples into one
<code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object we can move to the next steps
of integration, dimension reduction and clustering. We have implemented
<a href="https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger" class="external-link"><em>liger</em></a> for
integrating datasets from multiple samples, treatment and experiments.
For optimal integration user should try to use different k values.</p>
<p>Once data integration is done, dimension reduction is performed using
multiple methods by default i.e. “PCA”, “tSNE”, “UMAP”, “UMAP3D”. For
tSNE and UMAP, dimension reduction is performed using either PCA or
Liger values. Once the dimension reduction step is done the
<code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object is ready for clustering.</p>

<p>The next step is to annotate the celltypes for each cluster. Here, we
will use the package <a href="https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE" class="external-link"><em>ewce</em></a>. For this
we use the following command (This may take a while):-</p>

<p>We need to subset the merged <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object
to perform differential expression analysis. Here we are using
<code>MASTZLM</code> for differential expression analysis. For example,
we are interested in performing DE analysis in the <code>Oligo</code>
cell cluster. So, we first subset the <code>Oligo</code> cluster.</p>

analysis. If there are any confounding variables those colData names can
