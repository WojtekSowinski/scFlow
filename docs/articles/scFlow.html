<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="running-scflow">Running <em>scFlow</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#running-scflow"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>scFlow</code> pipeline requires three main input: a folder containing <code>matrix.mtx.gz</code>, <code>features.tsv.gz</code>, <code>barcodes.tsv.gz</code> for individual samples, a SampleSheet.tsv file which is a tab-separated-variable file with sample metadata and a Manifest.txt file is a tab-separated-variable file with two columns: <code>key</code> and <code>filepath</code>. Details of how to generate the files is given in this <a href="https://github.com/combiz/scFlow/wiki/Generating-a-Manifest-File-and-SampleSheet-for-scFlow" class="external-link">page</a></p>
<p>The basic <code>scFlow</code> workflow for sample QC begins with the import of the feature-barcode sparse matrix with <code>read_sparse_matrix</code>. The metadata for the sample is then imported from a sample sheet with <code>read_metadata</code>. A SingleCellExperiment object is created from the matrix and the metadata using <code>generate_sce</code> which is then annotated with both gene and cell-level data using <code>annotate_sce</code>. We then filter the SingleCellExperiment to select only cells and genes meeting our QC criteria using <code>filter_sce</code>. We can then optionally find singlets in our filtered SingleCellExperiment using <code>find_singlets</code> before filtering them out again with <code>filter_sce</code>. A complete QC report can then be generated using <code>report_qc_sce</code> before saving the filtered and quality-controlled SingleCellExperiment with <code>write_sce</code>.</p>

<p>For snRNAseq data generated by 10X genomics, the initial mapping of the raw fastq files to the reference genome generates raw_feature_bc_matrix and filtered_feature_bc_matrix. Ambient RNA profiling is performed optionally on the raw_feature_bc_matrix using the EmptyDrops algorithm to flag and subsequently filter cellular barcodes which do not deviate from an ambient RNA expression profile representing cell-free transcripts. This step is optional and will only work when starting from raw_feature_bc_matrix files. We did not run this step.</p>

<p>Once we merge all the samples into one <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object we can move to the next steps of integration, dimension reduction and clustering. We have implemented <a href="https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger" class="external-link"><em>liger</em></a> for integrating datasets from multiple samples, treatment and experiments. For optimal integration user should try to use different k values.</p>
<p>Once data integration is done, dimension reduction is performed using multiple methods by default i.e. “PCA”, “tSNE”, “UMAP”, “UMAP3D”. For tSNE and UMAP, dimension reduction is performed using either PCA or Liger values. Once the dimension reduction step is done the <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object is ready for clustering.</p>

<p>The next step is to annotate the celltypes for each cluster. Here, we will use the package <a href="https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE" class="external-link"><em>ewce</em></a>. For this we use the following command (This may take a while). To know how the <code>ctd</code> was generated please visit <code>EWCE</code> package webpage. Users can generate and provide custom <code>ctd</code>. The annotation level can be an integer or a named list as shown in the code.</p>

<p>Our pipeline generates multiple reports. <code>report_integrated_sce</code> generates a report on integration whereas <code>report_celltype_metrics</code> generates detailed metrics on cell type distribution. Before running <code>report_integrated_sce</code> and <code>report_celltype_metrics</code>, the user needs to run <code>annotate_integrated_sce</code> and <code>annotate_celltype_metrics</code> functions respectively.</p>

<p>We need to subset the merged <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object to perform differential expression analysis. Here we are using <code>MASTZLM</code> for differential expression analysis.

If there are any confounding variables those colData names can be passed through confounding_vars argument.</p>

<p>Single cell RNA seq data enables to study cell type composition in tissue and as a result we can perform a differential cell type composition analysis. We have implemented Dirichlet-multinomial regression analysis to compare cell type composition changes across a categorical dependent variables. <code>model_celltype_freqs</code> performs the differential composition analysis and generate plots. Here we will compare if there are any changes in the composition of cell types between <code>Controls</code> and <code>Cases</code>. Additional confounding variables can be passed via <code>confounding_vars</code> parameter.</p>
