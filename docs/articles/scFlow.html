<p>The goal of scFlow is to provide tools in R to build a complete
analysis workflow for single-cell/nuclei RNA sequencing data.</p>

clusters, or in the cloud. An accompanying NextFlow pipeline is in the
works - TBA.</p>

<h2 id="running-scflow">Running <em>scFlow</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#running-scflow"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>scFlow</code> pipeline requires three main input: a folder
containing <code>matrix.mtx.gz</code>, <code>features.tsv.gz</code>,
<code>barcodes.tsv.gz</code> for individual samples, a SampleSheet.tsv
file which is a tab-separated-variable file with sample metadata and a
Manifest.txt file is a tab-separated-variable file with two columns:
<code>key</code> and <code>filepath</code>. Details of how to generate
the files is given in this <a href="https://github.com/combiz/scFlow/wiki/Generating-a-Manifest-File-and-SampleSheet-for-scFlow" class="external-link">page</a></p>
<p>The basic <code>scFlow</code> workflow for sample QC begins with the
import of the feature-barcode sparse matrix with
<code>read_sparse_matrix</code>. The metadata for the sample is then
imported from a sample sheet with <code>read_metadata</code>. A
SingleCellExperiment object is created from the matrix and the metadata
using <code>generate_sce</code> which is then annotated with both gene
and cell-level data using <code>annotate_sce</code>. We then filter the
SingleCellExperiment to select only cells and genes meeting our QC
criteria using <code>filter_sce</code>. We can then optionally find
singlets in our filtered SingleCellExperiment using
<code>find_singlets</code> before filtering them out again with
<code>filter_sce</code>. A complete QC report can then be generated
using <code>report_qc_sce</code> before saving the filtered and
quality-controlled SingleCellExperiment with <code>write_sce</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we retrieve the metadata by pointing to a Sample Sheet and
specifying a unique identifier (unique_key) in a specific column

<p>For downstream analyses it’s important that the variable classes are
correctly specified. Carefully inspect the metadata classes in brackets.
In the above example we see that the <em>individual</em> were imported
as integer rather than factor variables. Let’s correct this by reloading
the metadata, this time specifying the correct variable classes for this
variable:-</p>

<p>In <code>scFlow</code> we specify all of our QC preferences and
cutoffs with the <code>annotate_sce</code> command. This will also
produce plots in the <code>sce@metadata</code> slot allowing rapid
revision and optimization of QC parameters. Lets start with the default
parameters by simply providing the <code>SingleCellExperiment</code>

<p>Once we merge all the samples into one
<code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object we can move to the next steps
of integration, dimension reduction and clustering. We have implemented
<a href="https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger" class="external-link"><em>liger</em></a> for
integrating datasets from multiple samples, treatment and experiments.
For optimal integration user should try to use different k values.</p>
<p>Once data integration is done, dimension reduction is performed using
multiple methods by default i.e. “PCA”, “tSNE”, “UMAP”, “UMAP3D”. For
tSNE and UMAP, dimension reduction is performed using either PCA or
Liger values. Once the dimension reduction step is done the
<code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object is ready for clustering.</p>

<p>The next step is to annotate the celltypes for each cluster. Here, we
will use the package <a href="https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE" class="external-link"><em>ewce</em></a>. For this
we use the following command (This may take a while). To know how the
<code>ctd</code> was generated please visit <code>EWCE</code> package
webpage. Users can generate and provide custom <code>ctd</code>. The
annotation level can be an integer or a named list as shown in the
code.</p>

<p>Our pipeline generates multiple reports.
<code>report_integrated_sce</code> generates a report on integration
whereas <code>report_celltype_metrics</code> generates detailed metrics
on cell type distribution. Before running
<code>report_integrated_sce</code> and
<code>report_celltype_metrics</code>, the user needs to run
<code>annotate_integrated_sce</code> and
<code>annotate_celltype_metrics</code> functions respectively.</p>

<p>We need to subset the merged <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object
to perform differential expression analysis. Here we are using
<code>MASTZLM</code> for differential expression analysis. For example,
we are interested in performing DE analysis in the <code>Oligo</code>
cell cluster. So, we first subset the <code>Oligo</code> cluster.</p>

<p>Single cell RNA seq data enables to study cell type composition in
tissue and as a result we can perform a differential cell type
composition analysis. We have implemented Dirichlet-multinomial
regression analysis to compare cell type composition changes across a
categorical dependent variables. <code>model_celltype_freqs</code>
performs the differential composition analysis and generate plots. Here
we will compare if there are any changes in the composition of cell
types between <code>Controls</code> and <code>Cases</code>. Additional
confounding variables can be passed via <code>confounding_vars</code>
parameter.</p>
